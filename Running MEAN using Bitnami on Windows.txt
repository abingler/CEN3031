Running with Bitnami on Windows:

1. Download and install the Bitnami MEAN stack installer here:
    https://bitnami.com/stack/mean
    
2. I had to set different default ports of 81 for Apache and 444 for SSL (just +1 the defaults) 

3. Run the MEAN environment batch file, from the install directory: 
    C:\Bitnami\meanstack-2.6.7-0\
    
4. Use NPM (Node Package Manager) to install the node.js dependencies that aren't automatically on the git repo.
    a) Do this by going to the CEN3031/Support directory:
        C:\Projects\CEN3031\support (or where ever you cloned git to)
    b) And typing:
        npm install
        
5. Stay in this directory and run the app with:
    node app
    
6. You should see "Express server listening on port 3000". In Chrome or Firefox just go to "http://localhost:3000" to see the app!

    Select that you have a technical problem and type something like "no sounds" or "freezes" to see the code in action.

7. This code doesn't use Mongo yet, so for those of you doing backend stuff, you'll need to set up a mongo database, which is described with Bitnami here:
